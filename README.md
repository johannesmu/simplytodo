# simplytodo
A simple to do list project built to be packaged in either a Cordova project or an Electron project. Tasks are persistent through the use of HTML localStorage facility and stored as an array of Javascript objects. All events are currently for touch screens only. Implemented without any libraries or frameworks, so pure vanilla.

Since the objective is to implement in Cordova or Electron environment, it has only been tested with Chrome and Safari.
### Feature:
- Swipe task right to mark it as done
- Tap revealed button to remove task
- Tap Clear button to remove all tasks that are done
